pebble install --emulator basalt
pebble install --logs --emulator basalt
app_event_loop() // watchapp wait for system events until it exits
pebble install --phone 192.168.1.78

Instead of using the --phone flag every time you install, set the PEBBLE_PHONE environment variable: export PEBBLE_PHONE=192.168.1.78 and simply use pebble install.

You need a 24x28 png and add it to the resources in your package.json:
{
            "menuIcon": true,
            "type": "png",
            "name": "IMAGE_MENU_ICON",
            "file": "images/menu.png"
 } 
I'm actually not sure what the max resolution is for the png, but I have been using 24x28
